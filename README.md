Dark Matter FPS
===============

**Dark Matter** is an in-progress **first-person shooter engine and game** being developed in **C++ with OpenGL**, focused on real-time rendering, physics, and low-level systems design.

⚠️ This project is currently in **early development**. The repository documents the **engine foundation and architecture** rather than finished gameplay or visuals.

Project Goals
-------------

Dark Matter is designed as a **from-scratch exploration of game engine fundamentals**, including:

*   Real-time 3D rendering using OpenGL
    
*   Player input handling and camera control
    
*   Basic physics and world interaction
    
*   Modular engine architecture in C++
    
*   Future AI-driven enemy behavior and gameplay systems
    

The long-term goal is to create a **fully playable FPS** while deeply understanding the **systems that power modern games**.

Current Status
--------------

Implemented so far:

*   OpenGL rendering context and window management
    
*   Core rendering pipeline setup
    
*   Player input handling and movement framework
    
*   Foundational physics behavior
    
*   Early engine structure and code organization
    

In progress:

*   Gameplay mechanics and interaction systems
    
*   Enemy AI behavior
    
*   Expanded physics and collision handling
    
*   Visual effects and rendering improvements
    

Planned:

*   Level system and world building
    
*   Audio integration
    
*   Performance optimization
    
*   Complete playable game loop
    

Why This Project Exists
-----------------------

This project is a **learning-driven engineering effort**, created to:

*   Strengthen **advanced C++ programming skills**
    
*   Understand **graphics pipelines and real-time rendering**
    
*   Explore **systems-level design similar to game engines**
    
*   Build a **substantial long-term technical project**
    

Dark Matter prioritizes **clean architecture and deep understanding** over rapid visual results.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Language:** C++
    
*   **Graphics:** OpenGL
    
*   **Platform:** Windows Desktop (cross-platform goals)
    
*   **Build System:** Premake

Development Philosophy
----------------------

*   Build core systems **from first principles**
    
*   Favor **clarity and learning** over shortcuts
    
*   Document progress as the engine evolves
    
*   Treat the project as a **long-term engineering study**
    

Future Direction
----------------

Planned advanced topics:

*   AI behavior and decision systems
    
*   Improved physics and collision detection
    
*   Rendering optimizations and effects
    
*   Complete playable FPS experience
